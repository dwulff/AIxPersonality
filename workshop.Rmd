## Venue

Seminaris CampusHotel Berlin,  Takustr. 39, 14195 Berlin, Germany [www.seminaris.de/](https://www.seminaris.de/hotels/tagungshotel-berlin-dahlem/)

## Goals

The meeting will include input presentations and group discussions aimed at collaboratively developing perspectives on the two main questions:

1) How can AI advance personality psychology?
2) How can personality psychology inform evaluations of AI? 

The primary goal is to outline and plan an article that disseminates our insights to both the psychology and artificial intelligence communities. 

## Organization

Each session will begin with two presentations by two experts: the first presentation (~20min) introduces the theme of the session, whereas the second presentation (~10min) outlines open questions for us to discuss. Following these presentations, we will will split up into smaller groups to discuss the session's theme and open questions (~45min). Finally we will gather the insights from the group discussions in a plenary session moderated by the two initial presenters (~45min).
