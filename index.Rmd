Artificial intelligence (AI) systems are increasingly capable of generating and interpreting human language with remarkable accuracy. This is particularly true of Large Language Models (LLMs), which are trained on extensive amounts of digitized content. As their real-world applications expand, research on AI and LLMs has grown rapidly, including investigations into their relevance for key questions in personality psychology. The integration between psychological and artificial intelligence research remains limited, leaving substantial opportunities for interdisciplinary collaboration untapped. This focus meeting seeks to bridge this gap by convening researchers from psychology and artificial intelligence to collaboratively address two core questions: 1) How can AI advance personality psychology? and 2) How can personality psychology inform evaluations of AI?
